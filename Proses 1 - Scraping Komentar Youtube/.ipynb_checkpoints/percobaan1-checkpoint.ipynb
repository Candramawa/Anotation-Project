      "Zion.T never disappoints. His voice is so emotional and this song matches the scenes so far. This song is so beautiful. ‚ú® I‚Äôm so excited to watch the rest of the story unfold in the coming weeks. I wonder how time works for these parallel universes, especially since it was young Lee Go who got the ID of adult Jung Tae Eul but 25 years ago she was only 5 years old. How will time affect their relationship in the future? And what‚Äôs with the rabbit/ Alice in Wonderland motif? And I‚Äôm also excited to see Lee Minho and Kim Goeun‚Äôs chemistry as lovers in the future. So far, I‚Äôm not really feeling it but that will most likely change as their characters in the drama grow closer.\n",
